# Encrpytor / Decryptor 

## Synopsis
Using only hazmat we are to implement a ransomware that encrypts a chosen file with CBC (AES_MODE), and then at a later time decrypt the same file back to it's original file

## Instructions
Place all file in a desired directory to encrypt/decrypt. Then execute Main.py and simply type the command upon prompted.
### encrypt (filename) + .(ext)
    ex. encrypt traktor.jpg
### decrypt (filename)
    ex. decrypt traktor
Note: decrypt command does not need the extension, it only requires the filename as it will help the program to determine if we encrypted it.
### create unicorn
    ex. create unicorn
Note: This is only to generate a new public and private key and create their respective .pem files

#Beware when a new key has been generated, if you didnt make a copy of the previous key file, the file will be forever gone in the land of the unicorns.
