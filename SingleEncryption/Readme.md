# Encrpytor / Decryptor 

## Synopsis
Using only hazmat we are to implement a ransomware that encrypts a chosen file with CBC (AES_MODE), and then at a later time decrypt the same file back to it's original file

## Instructions
Execute Main.py and simply type the command upon prompted.
### encrypt (filename) + .(ext)
    ex. encrypt traktor.jpg
### decrypt (filename)
    ex. decrypt traktor
Note: decrypt command does not need the extension, it only requires the filename as it will help the program to determine if we encrypted it.
